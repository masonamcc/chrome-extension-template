# Chrome Extension (Template)

## Introduction
This template will help you get started in creating a Google Chrome extension. This template primarily uses HTML, JavaScript, and you can add a CSS file if you'd like.

Follow [this link](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api) for the full **API Reference** documentation on Chrome API's. You'll likely use at least some of them in your extension project.
